# SenseSmart Region
This project is an open-source implementation which enables AR apps to be created against the SenseSmart Region backend.

The project is designed as a library, containing the relevant code in the folder js/. An experimental implementation is also included, and is simply done so in the index.html test page. If you want to create your own app using SenseSmart Region, simply use the library functions provided. Documentation is in the code. 

SenseSmart Region communicated with a FiWare backend, which holds and updates information about sensors. To enable 3D graphics, SenseSmart Region uses XML3D (https://github.com/xml3d/xml3d.js), and to simplify device gyro readouts, gyronorm.js (https://github.com/dorukeker/gyronorm.js) is used.
